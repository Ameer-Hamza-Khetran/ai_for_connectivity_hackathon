Public sector connectivity networks are digital infrastructures that provide internet and communication services to public institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, and government offices. These networks enable equitable access to essential services, fostering education, healthcare, governance, and economic development, particularly in underserved or remote areas. They are essential to bring connectivity, in our increasingly digitized world, to every corner of the globe.

# AI for Underserved Area Identification

## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s interconnected world, internet access is crucial for education, healthcare, and economic development. Unfortunately, many regions still suffer from inadequate connectivity, restricting their access to these essential services. This project aims to tackle this issue by identifying and ranking underserved regions based on internet connectivity and socio-economic factors using AI-powered solutions.

## What Are We Trying to Achieve?

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust AI model capable of identifying underserved areas and ranking them based on factors such as:

- Internet connectivity
- Population density
- Socio-economic status

By pinpointing these underserved regions, we aim to assist policymakers in prioritizing network expansion and resource allocation in a way that maximizes impact.

### Key Objectives:
- **Identify underserved regions** with limited connectivity.
- **Rank regions** according to socio-economic factors like income, education, and population density.
- **Provide actionable recommendations** for improving connectivity and ensuring equitable access to education, healthcare, and other essential services.

## How We Plan to Integrate AI

AI plays a pivotal role in this project by analyzing complex datasets from various sources. We leverage lightweight yet powerful AI models such as decision trees, clustering algorithms, and logistic regression to make accurate predictions and provide meaningful insights.

### AI Models & Techniques:
- **Decision Trees**: Used to classify regions as underserved or adequately served based on key features like bandwidth availability and literacy rates.
- **Clustering (e.g., K-Means)**: Groups regions with similar characteristics, helping identify clusters of underserved areas.
- **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification model that helps pinpoint underserved regions based on socio-economic and connectivity factors.

### AI-Powered Recommendations:
- **Priority Score**: Each region receives a score based on the population affected and the connectivity gap, helping prioritize areas for network expansion.
- **What-If Analysis**: Simulate different scenarios (e.g., increasing bandwidth) to assess the potential impact of improving connectivity in underserved regions.

## The Impact of AI

The integration of AI significantly enhances the decision-making process and policy implementation. The insights provided by AI help:

- **Policymakers** make data-driven decisions on where to focus efforts for network expansion, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively.
- **Optimize resource allocation** by identifying the regions where improvements in connectivity will yield the greatest benefits.
- **Improve access** to education, healthcare, and other essential services, thereby enhancing the quality of life and fostering economic growth in underserved regions.
